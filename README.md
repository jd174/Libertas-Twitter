# Libertas Twitter
Gather info on tweets via the frontend API


Currently this module can gather info on the users who have liked a tweet and return this information as a Pandas dataframe/CSV document.

The rate limit on the front end API is 500 queries per 15min and around 90 users can be gathered per query.




There is currently an example app that can be run - "App.py". It takes a tweet ID and returns a CSV of the likers.

Make sure to configure the ExampleConfig.txt file in this directory and then rename it as the comment in the file suggests. 


ToDo: Eventually I will get a requiremnts document written up.
